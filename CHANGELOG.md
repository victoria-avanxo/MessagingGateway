## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Mattermost integration** — full channel support via WebSocket inbound + REST v4 outbound
  - New `mattermost` channel and provider type
  - `MessagingPort` adapter: text, media upload (multipart), threaded replies via `root_id` resolution
  - `ConnectionManagerPort` + `SocketManagerPort`: persistent WebSocket (`wss://…/api/v4/websocket`) with authentication, reconnect backoff, dedup guard, and bot-message skip
  - `ProviderHealthChecker`: `GET /api/v4/users/me` for identity discovery and credential validation
  - Content mapper: `mapPostToContent` (text, image, audio, video, document from `file_ids`) and `buildMattermostEnvelope`
  - `wireEvents`: socket `posted` → `UnifiedEnvelope` → `MESSAGE_INBOUND`; connection status → `CONNECTION_UPDATE`
  - Auto-connects via `connectManagedProviders` (no webhook controller or `server.ts` change)
  - `ws` WebSocket client dependency added
  - `MattermostIdentity` added to `AccountIdentity` union
  - 27 unit tests (adapter, mapper, health checker)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **`POST /api/v1/accounts/:id/reset`** — clears the stored session/credentials and reconnects so a fresh QR is generated. Use when the stored auth is expired and the account is stuck looping between `connecting` and `disconnected` without emitting a QR (previously only recoverable by deleting `data/baileys-auth/<id>` over SSH). Poll `GET /api/v1/accounts/:id` for the new QR. Only supported by self-auth (managed) providers; returns `400 RESET_NOT_SUPPORTED` otherwise. Backed by a new optional `clearSession` capability on `ConnectionManagerPort`, implemented by the Baileys adapter.

### Security

- The Baileys `clearSession` delete is confined to the managed auth root, so a free-form `authDir` in `providerConfig` (e.g. `../../..`) can no longer trigger an arbitrary recursive delete via the reset endpoint.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp device linking** — new QR / pairing-code links were rejected by WhatsApp (`Connection Failure` → `401 loggedOut`) while existing sessions kept working. Baileys now advertises the live WhatsApp Web version via `fetchLatestBaileysVersion()` (fetched once and cached per process), falling back to a pinned version only if the fetch fails. The previous hardcoded version became outdated and blocked new links.
- **`waVersion` override ignored** — `parseBaileysConfig` dropped the `waVersion` field, so per-account overrides in `accounts.yaml` never took effect. It is now parsed and validated.

### Changed

- Upgraded `@whiskeysockets/baileys` from `^7.0.0-rc.9` to `^7.0.0-rc13`.
- Added a configurable `qrTimeoutMs` (default `60000`) controlling the Baileys QR / pairing window.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Message persistence** — full bidirectional storage of inbound and outbound messages
  - SQLite (default, zero config) and PostgreSQL drivers
  - Lazy-loaded drivers: `better-sqlite3` or `pg` only required when enabled
  - Configurable via `STORAGE_ENABLED`, `STORAGE_DRIVER`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_PATH`
- **Migration system** — numbered SQL scripts per driver with checksum tracking
  - `MigrationRunner` with `MigrationAdapter` port (SQLite + PostgreSQL adapters)
  - Idempotent: safe to run multiple times, tracks applied migrations in `_migrations` table
  - FTS delete trigger (`002_fts_delete_trigger.sql`) prevents orphaned search entries
- **Full-text search** — search across stored messages
  - SQLite: FTS5 virtual table with content sync triggers
  - PostgreSQL: `tsvector` + GIN index with `plainto_tsquery`
  - `GET /api/v1/messages/search?q=keyword` endpoint
- **Analytics & statistics** — aggregated message metrics
  - `GET /api/v1/messages/analytics` — stats by channel, direction, content type, hourly distribution
  - `GET /api/v1/messages/stats` — simple count with filters
  - `GET /api/v1/messages/export` — CSV or JSON bulk export
- **Conversation context** — AI-ready conversation history
  - `GET /api/v1/conversations/:id/context` — chronological messages with participant info
  - `format=openai` maps direction to `user`/`assistant` roles
  - `format=raw` returns full `UnifiedEnvelope` objects
- **Message query API** — filter and paginate stored messages
  - `GET /api/v1/messages` — filter by account, channel, conversation, direction, date range
  - `GET /api/v1/messages/:id` — retrieve single message by ID
- **WhatsApp LID resolution** — bidirectional conversation tracking
  - Resolves WhatsApp Logical IDs (`@lid`) to phone-based JIDs using Baileys `signalRepository`
  - Preserves original LID and resolved JID in `channelDetails` for future use
  - Applies `jidNormalizedUser()` to strip device suffixes (e.g., `:0`)
- **Outbound message persistence** — stores sent messages with full envelope metadata
  - `MessageRouterService` emits `MESSAGE_OUTBOUND` event after successful send
  - Uses `remoteJid` from provider response when available for accurate `conversationId`
  - Sender identity resolved from account identity (phone number, bot ID, etc.)
- **Media download at inbound** — Baileys provider downloads media inline
  - `downloadBaileysMedia()` extracts and base64-encodes media from WAMessage
  - Non-blocking: continues without media on download failure
  - Populates `content.media.base64` and `content.media.filename` on the envelope
- **Docker compose profiles** for testing: `sqlite` (port 3201) and `postgres` (port 3202)
- **SDK v0.3.0** — full type exports for persistence and analytics
  - Exports all core messaging types (`UnifiedEnvelope`, `MessageContent`, `ContactRef`, etc.)
  - Exports account and webhook types (`Account`, `WebhookConfig`, `CreateAccountInput`, etc.)
  - Exports persistence types (`MessageQuery`, `MessageQueryResult`, `MessageStats`, `ConversationContext`, `ConversationMessage`, `ConversationContextOptions`)
  - `MessagesApi` sub-client: `query()`, `search()`, `analytics()`, `export()`, `conversationContext()`
- **n8n nodes v0.2.0** — message persistence operations
  - Query: filter stored messages by account, conversation, direction, content type, date range
  - Search: full-text search across stored messages
  - Analytics: aggregated message statistics
  - Export: bulk export messages as CSV or JSON
  - Conversation Context: AI-ready conversation history with OpenAI/raw format support

### Changed

- **Architecture refactoring (DDD/SOLID/Clean Code)**
  - `MessageStorePort` segregated into `MessageStorePort` (CRUD), `MessageSearchPort` (FTS), `MessageAnalyticsPort` (stats), `ConversationHistoryPort` (raw history) — Interface Segregation Principle
  - `FullMessageStorePort` composite interface for full-featured store implementations
  - `ConversationContextService` extracts AI formatting from stores to application service — eliminates duplication between SQLite and PostgreSQL
  - Port moved from `src/persistence/` to `src/core/persistence/` (domain layer)
  - Controller moved from `src/persistence/` to `src/connections/api/` (transport layer)
  - Shared utilities moved to `src/core/persistence/message-store.utils.ts`
  - OpenAI role vocabulary (`user`/`assistant`/`system`) removed from domain port — lives only in `ConversationContextService`
- **Store initialization** — fail-fast instead of silent degradation
  - `requireDb()` / `requirePool()` throw `Error` if store not initialized
  - Replaces silent `if (!db) return empty` guards in every method
- **Migration orchestration** — moved from `store.init()` to factory
  - `init()` now only handles connection setup
  - `runMigrations()` is a separate method called by the factory
  - Single Responsibility Principle: stores don't know about migration adapters
- **Migration runner** — typed logger, removed non-null assertions
  - Extracted `MigrationLogger` interface, field typed as non-optional
  - `this.logger` instead of `this.logger!` throughout
- **Migration path resolution** — fail-fast on missing directory
  - `resolveMigrationScriptsDir()` throws with all probed paths instead of silent fallback
- **`parseJsonColumn` / `parseJsonColumnRequired`** — now generic with type parameters
  - `parseJsonColumn<T>(): T | undefined` instead of returning `any`
- **CSV export** — removed `as any` cast, uses discriminated union narrowing
  - Named constants `DEFAULT_EXPORT_LIMIT` (1000) and `DEFAULT_QUERY_LIMIT` (50)
- **Group name cache** — key includes `accountId` to prevent cross-account contamination
- **`MessageResult`** — added `remoteJid?: string` for provider-returned JID
- **`MessageRouterService`** — `eventBus` passed as typed parameter instead of non-null assertion
- **`SqliteMigrationAdapter`** — typed `Database.Database` instead of `any`
- **`resolve-scripts-dir`** — removed ESM-incompatible `require.main` fallback

### Fixed

- WhatsApp inbound DMs used LID-based `conversationId` (`@lid`) while outbound used phone-based JID — now both resolve to the same phone-based JID
- Phone JID with device suffix (e.g., `34600000099:0@s.whatsapp.net`) normalized to `34600000099@s.whatsapp.net`
- Docker `conflict type:replaced` error when multiple gateways compete for same WhatsApp session
- `Content-Length` mismatch with emoji in JSON payloads
